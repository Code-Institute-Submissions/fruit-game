## Purpose

The aim of this project was to create and build a single page application - playable game that that increases in complexity over the course of the game and challenges the player more and more.

## UX 

Starting with a desktop first approach I created a very basic wireframe. [Wireframe and notes](https://res.cloudinary.com/www-madine-se/image/upload/v1585001794/fruit_game/Untitled_Artwork_2_zccka0.jpg) from first mentor call. I did not find the need to create any more detailed mockups and wireframes because the design is so simple. 

 The design of this page is clean and fresh. I used neutral colors for the background and the back of the cards so the user can concentrate on the front of the cards which have different pastel backgrounds and the fruits are in rich colors. 

To create the cards I created a Photoshop file with numerous artboards and imported the back of the card and the individual fruit vectors. Then added pastel backgrounds in slightly contrasting colors. The  screenshot of initial card design can be found [here](https://res.cloudinary.com/www-madine-se/image/upload/v1585001211/fruit_game/Screenshot_2020-03-23_at_21.49.36_gvqbya.png).

Goals to be achieved of this website: 

* Create a playable game
* Simple and straightforward use
* Be able to have levels with varying difficulty levels
* Ability to play the game on different sized screens

I got rather lucky finding the perfect free fruit vectors as it took seconds of googling when I'm always very picky about the images I choose.

* Game starts with a "Click to start" overlay
* The cards sligthy increase in size when hovered over
